# MIML-CT

We propose a model called MIML-CT from the paper An Explainable Multi-instance Multi-label Classification Modelfor Full Slice Brain CT Images.

The csv files are the prediction of MIML-CT and RSNA-1 model, and the sequence-level true label.

This is the architecture of our model: ![image](https://github.com/GuanghuiFU/MIML-CT/blob/master/architecture.png)
